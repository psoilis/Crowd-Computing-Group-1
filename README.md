# Crowd Computing Assignment - Credibility Assessment :mortar_board:

Crowd computing assignment created using [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/) for the crowdsourcing part and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) for the Machine Learning part. This project is done for TU Delft's course Crowd Computing (CS4145) 2019.

## System Overview :green_book:

Explain about the tasks and what we want to achieve

### Crouwdsourcing Task #1

Explain things about task 1 and how we use it for the ML part. An example of our first annotation task is showcased in the image below.

### Machine Learning Task

## Setup :computer:

### Figure Eight
* Create a user account on [Figure Eight](https://make.figure-eight.com/jobs)
* Upload data from `Figure_Eight/data/figure8_dataset.xlsx`
* Copy code from `Figure_Eight/initial/` for CML, CSS and Javascript under "Design" tab
* Change name of the task
* Change "Rows Per Page" to 5 under "Settings -> Pay"
* Create Honeypot Questions under "Quality" tab
* Change minimum time per page to 60s under "Settings -> Quality Control -> Quality Control Settings"
* Change minimum accuracy for Test questions to 60% under "Settings -> Quality Control -> Test Questions"
* Navigate to "Launch" tab and change Judgments per Row
* Launch job  
  
  
* Repeat for low confidence task, except do not upload data. Also, take CML, CSS and Javascript code
from `Figure_Eight/low_confidence/` this time.

### Parsing Figure Eight's Output

### Machine Learning Classifiers 

### Pasing the Classification output for the second task
